# Random-PW-Generator

##Overview

A random password generator based on users specifications which include a combination of either:
- uppercase letters
- lowercase letters
- special characters (!@#$)
- numbers

## "How does it work?"

First, you would select a character number range, between 8 and 32. After selecting the length (ayo?) of your password you would select whether or not you want a combination of special characters, numbers, upper and lowercase letters. 

Once you have selected your parameters, you can just click 'Get Random Password' and bam (see screenshot no. 2)!

To copy your password just click the text box and it automatically copies your new randomly generated password. 

For maximum entropy, select a password of 32 characters and include special characters, numbers and both upper/lowercase letters. 

## "Why would one need this?"

Generating a random password add a level of complexity that makes it harder for bad actors to gain access to whatever it is that you have password protected. 

Combining this with a password manager adds to security stack.
